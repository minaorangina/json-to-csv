# JSON to CSV

Tiny function that converts a JSON or a Javascript object to a comma-separated values (`csv`).

Useful for extracting data from your No-SQL database to a spreadsheet :smile:


### Usage

Will actually publish to NPM eventually.

For now, clone the repo and extract the file into your project.

The function accepts EITHER an Array of objects OR an JSON string of an Array of objects.
